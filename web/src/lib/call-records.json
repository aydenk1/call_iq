Maybe you can help me.  Intermittently, I'll be running the darn thing,  and the flame will just go out up top.  And it's not always when the oven's running.  It's just there's no systematic.

When this oven was kicking on initially, the top flame would just go down to about nothing.  And I thought, well, maybe it's the sensor for that that's not letting it kick on.

Do you do in-home service repairs?  No, listen, I'm just a terrible person when it comes to warranties.  And I purchased it last July, I believe.  And then my dad had cancer, long story short, and I had to leave to go out of town.  So I don't even know if I ever even turned in the warranty information.

They may ask for some information from you that maybe you can narrow it down like a model number  and then see if it's under warranty and then just go from there.  Then they might send you somebody, but if it's not under warranty, what appliance is it?  what seems to be the issue was a model number I'm usually yeah I don't know if  it's a top loader from and then you live here in Wabash the address again what's  that Zipka will do for now is just write the service call up send it to our  technician and then he makes his own schedule so he will be calling you to  schedule a time to come out and then we'll just take it from there and then  see what he says the service call itself  It's gonna be 155 and then any parts and stuff like that after he diagnosed to that it's gonna be additional  So he's gonna have to look at it. We get the rest of that quote  Does it have the warranty from Lowe's or anything? We I don't know we don't close  I don't I'm not too sure. Alrighty said that was in 2016 516. Okay. I was like  Okay. Yeah, I will send this over to him and then just let us know and then we'll just go from there if we need to  Cancel it you go through Lowe's. Thank you"

Okay, so then my recommendation would be a mid-tier tire.  That would be a Kelly tire, so that's 65,000 mile warranty.  For a full set, is that what you're looking for, a full set?  Full set would be 718 and 44 cents.  It's mounted, balanced, and after tax.  Next recommendation would be, it looks like a Mastercraft Stratus all season.  It still has a warranty, but it's 50,000 miles.  And for a full set of four, it's $545.96."

And then, like I said, as soon as my closing goes through tomorrow and the money is clear enough that I can go ahead and make a large sizable.  payment then i will get with you guys and get that get a decent sized payment made at least  the 6300 which was what i was expecting to pay right now and we'll kind of see where i go from  there on the remaining payment of that because i didn't anticipate it being that much more so  and i didn't realize my battery was shot either so that was another thing  because i didn't have much of an issue with it before the engine itself started having issues so  Okay. We can go with that. That's not a problem. I'll figure out how to work that out as I  progress in all of this, but I'll definitely be paying the majority of it off when I get  clearance from the bank on the mortgage loan then. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I think we can work  something out with that. I think that would work. Okay. I appreciate it. Okay. I'll give  you guys a call tomorrow and let you know when I can stop in then. Okay.

Once the work order is shared with you, you are open to contacting the homeowner.  There's no stipulations there.  and on your first visit we just require you to diagnose what the problem is and it would be  great if you could submit the diagnosis on the spot the reason why we ask this is that we have  a 10-minute approval policy so once you submit a diagnosis you get an approval within 10 minutes  once the approval is in you can complete the repairs and then send us your invoice"

It's rated for severe snow, three-peak mountain snowflake rating.  A full set of four mounted bounce and aftertacks and everything.  You'll be looking at $12.47 and two cents.  And that comes with a 60-day satisfaction guarantee, so...  You can drive it for the 60 days, and if you don't seem to like how it drives  or for any reason, you can bring it back and get something under that same brand.  It's a Weather Ready 2 tire, but it's a good year tire.  Thank you."

So I'm going to see what he thinks it's going to be.  I'm going to put you on a hold.  Give me one second.  Billy said be able to quote it out.  I think that you'd probably need the rep calipers  because if you said they're working,  it could be a whole litany of issues.  You're not having like any leaking brake fluid, are you?  Yeah, I really do think it's going to be best  if you can just swing by in the vehicle sometime,  then we can...  really get you an idea of what we're looking at um just tight unseen kind of hard to quote it out  like i i can still quote you out the calipers if you want but i think in it yeah yeah i mean  we'll definitely quote you out it's not like we'll just surprise you with a big bill or anything but  that's probably going to be the best way to go um let me just quote you out real quick on  police master cylinder chain caliper give you an idea option with hydro boost i don't know if you  know as that or not i'll just go on the high side it's an extra half hour labor head gasket"

Well, I told her, I said, I'm really surprised that you don't have those Walton Thomas listed on your, that comes up on your, I'm going to call it a formulary, but that has, you know, like appliances for sale.  Because I said, honestly, they're about the best place to buy an appliance at.  Because you got Risher and you got Wabash Appliance, and I wouldn't give you a dime for neither one of them.  I wouldn't, because I bought stuff from Risher, and I don't like the way they do things, and they're not very good at communication.  And I don't like the Wabash Appliance, because you don't know how to tell the truth.

It's going to be a bit more energy efficient.  It's going to be a bit quieter, stuff like that.  Yeah.  So do you have that model number, the PDT that I gave you?  I know the thing on which one it is.  Yeah, this one has the \u2013  twin turbo dry boost for that for that one there that one's going to be a bit better it's going to  have uh like two fans in it and you should uh have like an exhaust fan inside so it should be a bit  better at the drying but the other one's still proficient um it is still a higher quality model  it's just not going to be the same as a profile quieter and then the profile is going to uh have  the twin turbo uh drying yep yep the other one will do still do just fine i do not actually  yeah i do not actually but um yeah uh so would in my opinion if you are doing a lot of dishes  you do it for multiple people i would just go with uh the profile because it's going to dry it  bit better so you don't have to worry about the uh sometimes when things don't get dry fully you get  that what's called like that rust like the grime build up on your uh silver and stuff when the water  you don't really want that especially if you use it quite often um that's what i would recommend  uh get the best bang for your buck uh 8332 um what was the year you were wanting on those like  how many years the price is going to vary on that warranty so if the model costs less sometimes that  warranty okay and then what was the quote on that profile series how much today the 8332 is probably"

I don't know if it necessarily looked like a Loctite or anything like that, but it actually looked more like there might have been some kind of sealant put around that drain plug.  That's nothing that you guys would have done when you did the oil change.  You would have replaced the gasket on the filler plug and put it back in if it needed any, if it was leaking from the plug.  Okay.  Okay.  I know some of the drain plugs will have that little, like, gasket on it.  If it had one of those, you would have replaced that instead of putting silicone on it, right?  Okay.  Okay.

I had been looking at it earlier today, the quote that you sent,  and I was going to get back with you today, so it was good timing.  So thanks for following up.  And the first question I had is when \u2013 do you know when the \u2013  and you may have said this in your email, but I didn't see it \u2013  when they would arrive, estimated time of arrival for the appliances for January?  Okay.  um and so uh and and that's fine it's good to know the current wall oven works fine everything  works the the but um there's some things that are kind of wonky so we're trying to get everything  cleaned up for somebody to to uh to uh rent it out for airbnb um so there's two differences  i i ran prices under lowes pro my lowes pro the only difference was uh the 30 inch  Rangehood, they sell for $248.31 versus $279.  I figured you'd match that, and, of course, I can provide that quote to you."

I might need some help with the double oven because the guy that's helping me now doesn't know if his availability will be what it will be like in January."

And then after you get all of them, you can get all the CO numbers and go back in there, and that'll kind of reserve that rebate for you."
